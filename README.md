# ðŸ“ž ShellPhone - Local Contacts App

ShellPhone is a simple **React Native Expo** app that allows users to **add, view, and call contacts**.  
The contacts are stored **locally** on the device using **AsyncStorage**, ensuring they persist even after closing the app.

As well as calling contacts, they can share their location from the map-page.
